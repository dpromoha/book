# book

Book is a simple and intuitive iOS application that allows users to search for books, save them to their list, and discover their Harry Potter house. The primary goal of this project was to explore SwiftUI for the first time, incorporating a variety of basic elements such as Grids, Groups, Lists, and more. Additionally, a significant portion of the app is covered by unit and UI tests. Note that unit tests do not cover network requests, as the app uses free APIs which are not practical to test extensively.

## Features

- **SwiftUI Elements**: Includes various `SwiftUI` components like `Grids`, `Groups`, and `Lists` for a seamless user experience.
- **Book Search**: Effortlessly search for books using a responsive search bar, implemented with UIKit to testÂ `UIViewRepresentable`.
- **Personal Book List**: Save your favorite books to a personalized list for quick access, using `CoreData`.
- **Harry Potter House**: Discover your Harry Potter house, enjoy nice `SwiftUI` animations, and experience theme color changes.
- **Testing**: Extensive unit and UI tests to ensure app functionality and stability, except for network requests due to the use of free APIs.
